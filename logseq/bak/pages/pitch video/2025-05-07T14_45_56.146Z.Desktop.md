		- this is pondlife: discone (a videogame). an online, multiplayer, momentum-based 3d-platformer. a difficult climbing game, but one that's nice. it's an open game about opt-in challenge. about finding climbing paths and attempting them. it's a world for 
		  players to find a far-off spire, dance, or play tag, while chatting about their day. it's a new playground.

		- we started this game as our master's thesis at the nyu game center. we've been working on it since, alongside an amazing community of collaborators, mentors and peers in brooklyn.

		- big claim, we know.

		- we've dialed in the fundamentals: moving and jumping. simply moving your 
		  character around (even jumping in place!) should be an endless source of discovery.
		- movement is analog. small variations in input, terrain, and **momentum** produce a deep, explorable possibility space. each new attempt at an obstacle should feel fresh.
		- and **momentum** is not only about fast, flowing lines. it's also careful and considered. changing a single step may be all it takes reach the next ridge.
		- the climb is the joy of exploring the nuances of your character and its interaction with...
	- **"openness" & discovery**

		- ...an open, free, unknown world. we're building a world that eases you in 
		  through designed structures, but removes them as you ascend. until only 
		  organic boulders remain.
		- this openness is the chance to pick a route, try a jump, or recover from a 
		  mistake not only that you never have before, but that **nobody** has before.
		- this is real discovery, and it's **yours**.
		- some routes might be **really** hard. we love difficulty, but we want you to take a deep breath and plant a flower when you need to. this is not a ragegame.

		- it's an online game. you don't have to struggle alone. you can learn from others and share what you know with them, too. you might find remnants of another player's experience entices you forward, only to find that player...
		- ...and chase them as they run away from you. you might challenge each other to a race, a difficult jumps, or a game of horse.
		- we're both passionate about folk games. tag, tug of war: the ones you might've played as a kid. twitch streamers already play hide and seek online in mario odyssey, we want to bring that spirit to everyone with discone. to create a world for players to play their own games . maybe this spot is a good hiding spot...
		- it's a place to be with your friends, or with strangers, to play games or to hang out, to teach, learn, connect. and jump.
	- **for tryhards, for casual groups of friends, for...**
	  2 ??s 66w
		- we're making this game for many people...
		- for casual groups of friends, looking for a run and jump hike together as they chat about their days.
		- for tryhards who want refine every nuance in their movement, become untaggable, optimize routes, make a world-first summit.
		- for committed groups of gamers, who want to follow one another to far off vistas, scale every tower, unravel the deep lore.
