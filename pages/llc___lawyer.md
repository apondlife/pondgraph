- #meeting [[2025/04/24]] - initial call
	- Jacqueline Redabaugh
	- Dayton Ohio
	- Otter.ai notetaking
	- overview
		- not intended foe legal advice
		- project legal needs
		- interview both ways
	- ty: we wanna pitch our game to have funds and start worker owned org, legal entity to deal with publisher, short term, end of may
		- long term: game studio where everyone is worker owner, making games in a sustainable way. realize our creative vision
		- we worked with more people, but only the two of us maintained the long term commitment
	- jacque: they at least 3 games as their clients that could share expertise
		- jacque: what do you know about coops?
	- ty: we did the class, and we made boshis place as a non-profit, exercising consensus based procedures with a big group. the legal aspects, ny doesn't really have a legal thing
		- jacque: ny is a pain for coops
	- ty: "you can always operate this way even if you are not legally this way"
	- ty: the legal distinction is not necessary to be 1:1
	- jacqui: revenue?
	- ty: right now we have no revenue, we've been self funding the game. start pitching this project to publishers. if that successful, we would be hoping to get 400~500k as an advance so we can pay salary and possibly new people / contractors.
	- ty: in 2-3 years we hope the game is released, and successful, and we can bring more people in. even with just the advance we could bring more people in.
	- ty: we only really have the capacity to work on this one from
	- j: full time/part time?
	- ty: its been part time for a long time, but now full time for this year.
	- j: any questions?
	- ty: this is the lawyer we got as a recommendation.
	- j: why do you need a legal entity rn? i usually tell if there's more than one person its a good idea. its early on in investment. but we can work together to find a fixed fee engagement. how do you think having this in place will help getting a publisher.
	- ty: steam, we have a steam account, that is currently directly associated to me and my personal account. i don't want my personal bank account there, and the money going to my personal checkings account. but then if we do get funding, we worry about publishers taking creative credits from projects, consumers associating the game's creative to the publisher rather than the studio itself. i wouldn't want to fall in a situation where the publisher has control over us
	- j: ny doesnt have coops. for you LLC will be the most straightforward. form an LLC in another state, and registered in new york, but that can be a nightmare. the only reason why people do that is so they can use the name coop in the name. llc can have something else to describe the way you work (collective).
	- j: i'd offer you a fixed fee of 5000k. one meeting putting paperwork together. articles of organization. no need to do a personal agreement(?). a number of calls  in between
	- j: we have a free course on our website. in the decision making you re doing the heavy lift. taxation has some aspects that are helpful to know. and then work on the business plan.
	- t: do you have a resource for what we would put into a business plan?
	- j: i have a few frameworks that can help you. having a good sense of industry, where you place there, how does money go in and out. whats the business model that allows it to be a business.
	- t: what do we do about mut's visa situation. we have other friends that started LLC, that made no money, but they ended up needed to pay a bunch of money.
	- j: as long as mut is not an employee of the LLC, and not taxed as a corporation, but that's ok. if you have a permanent residence not just a tourist visa, even not having that is fine. llc member as a partnership. means that the individuals are expected to report taxes, but no w2 requirements. the ITIN would be enough to not get into trouble. if there's more about the legal status, and we have an associate that works with immigration.
	- m: should we rush?
	- j: you can get an EIN with the name of a company, even if you have no entity formed, so you can open a bank account. and you can sort of operate as a sole proprietor. and that addresses the need of the bank account. the main thing to have an entity early is between the 2 of you, and in case a separation happens, personal assets not being on the line. we share the risk. you can get an EIN and put things on paper, and if we separate, and we both sign, that could be enough. bank can resolve quite easily
	- j: starting wouldn't take too long. ny has the 2 week publication thing, and you can start a company in that time. so you can wait to have something lined up. you don't have external liability, third party clients &c makes things easier
	- t: EIN=>entity later?
	- j: you cn go for an EIN, don't choose corporation, choose partnership, the money that comes into will be taxed on the person that is there. if you wanna stay lean until that time, your best use of money will be to spend an hour with an accountant.
	- t: being taxed as individuals vs company? can the company hold money?
	- j: LLC unlike a corp doesn't have proper reserves, you will be fully taxed on the money that comes into the company. that could be avoided if it's a corp, but thats more tricky in the immigration.
	- j: took me 4 months to get the green card work permit. you need a SSN or tax number. i would talk with an accountant for more details.
	- t: if moochi has a green card, would the corp be totally fine?
	- j: yeah, even if you have a work visa tahts fine.
	- j: let me know next decisions you make.
